# UniteHQ To Do

Saved TODO (canonical):

- Add admins to multiple orgs even if they are not platform admins. They will view the platform page with all of the cards they have access to when they login.
- Test multiple team, coach and parent mass upload
- Announcements should show date and time it was sent
- Gamified ticketing for staff. % of monthly revenue distributed to top ticket answering staff
- Give individual players access to app either through parent requesting or them signing up on their own. Consent message attached
- Academy setup (blank operations, individual, teams)
- Realtime Player Plan generation: as soon as the player is evaluated by the coach or individual parent then it immediately shows in their plans section without having to go to a different tab and come back.
- Parents with multiple players in league
- Legit landing page using screenshots if needed
- Realtime emojis in chat for all cards
- Push notifications and setting of terms and conditions and support email linked to actually mail to support email. support@unite-hq.com
- Parents first login slideshow modal for league/teams card CSV import. Parent is imported by admin, they receive email, click link to set password and then click join which takes them to the app dashboard. That is when the modal shows
- Finish cancellation issues on individual members card. They should receive an email after pressing cancel. Everything else works.
